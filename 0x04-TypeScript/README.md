# TypeScript Project

This project is a collection of tasks aimed at learning and practicing TypeScript.

## About TypeScript

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, adding optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.

### Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain familiarity with the following TypeScript concepts:

- Basic types in TypeScript
- Interfaces, Classes, and functions
- Working with the DOM and TypeScript
- Generic types
- Using namespaces
- Merging declarations
- Using ambient Namespace to import external libraries
- Basic nominal typing with TypeScript

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several tasks, each focusing on specific TypeScript concepts. Here's an overview of the task directories:

- `task_0`: Interface creation and basic rendering.
- `task_1`: Building interfaces and classes.
- `task_2`: Advanced types and class implementations.
- `task_3`: Ambient namespaces and declaration merging.
- `task_4`: Namespace and declaration merging continuation.
- `task_5`: Advanced types Part 1.
- `task_6`: Creating functions specific to employees.
- `task_7`: String literal types.
- `task_8`: Ambient namespaces.
- `task_9`: Namespace & Declaration merging.
- `task_10`: Update task_4/js/main.ts.
- `task_11`: Brand convention & Nominal typing.

Each task directory contains the necessary configuration files, such as `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `webpack.config.js`, along with TypeScript code files in the `js` directory.
